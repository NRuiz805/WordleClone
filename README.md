# Python Wordle Clone

### What is this project?

> Python Wordle Clone is a project meant to be a way for me to learn Python experientially and be my testing ground for Rich Console.
> It is the first project created by me that is fully coded inside Visual Studio Code. In this project, I learned how to
> * Install modules using the command ```pip[3] install [module_name]``` in PowerShell/Command Prompt.
> * Import modules using the ```from``` and ```import``` keywords in Visual Studio Code.
> * Utilize the ```requests``` module to pull JSON data from APIs using ```requests.get([URL])```
